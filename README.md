This project optimizes radiologist scheduling using advanced mathematical and machine learning techniques. It employs a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for assigning tasks and workstations to radiologists based on their availability and location preferences. To address the lack of complete historical data, synthetic data simulations are used to generate comprehensive datasets that reflect real-world scenarios. Additionally, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hyperparameter optimization is used to predict future work location preferences. This repository includes the code for these models, aimed at improving resource allocation, enhancing staff satisfaction, and minimizing outsourcing costs, offering a scalable and adaptive scheduling framework for healthcare systems.
